<p>I believe that a hero is someone who is brave, motivational, kind, committed, etc. I cannot possibly list every adjective that I think accurately describes a hero because if I did, I'd be writing for weeks.</p>

<p>Heroes fight for the underdog repeatedly and are not afraid to sacrifice their own personal integrity to make sure that underrepresented communities get equal spotlight. Jane Fonda fits this description perfectly. Ever since she was put into the spotlight, she consistently motivated the masses in numerous ways. While she obviously motivated people through her workout videos, that isn't what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>Jane Fonda has been proponent for equal rights among all people, regardless of race, social class, sexuality, gender, and more. She participated in the gay rights protests back in 1970 and consistently used her platform to vocalize the struggles LGBTQ+ people had on a daily basis to help others understand and sympathize with them more. In one interview, Jane Fonda was asked if she was only partaking in performative activisim and if she felt like she was being used by the LGBTQ+ movement for her platform and promptly replied that she didn't care if people were using her for her platform because if she's being used for a good reason, then who cares? Jane Fonda was even willing to get arrested for the underrepresented peoples of America, which should really speak for itself, as she was willing to risk her lengthy career alongside friends and family for the greater good of America and the world as a whole.</p>
